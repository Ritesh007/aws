## Auto Scaling Launch Templates:

- Launch templates (LTs) are newer than launch configurations (LCs) and 
  provide more options to work with. Thus, the AWS documentation recommends 
  use of launch templates (LTs) over launch configuration (LCs)
- Launch Configuration will face out at the end of 2022
- We can reuse and extend launch templates
- You can create a launch template from a launch configuration
